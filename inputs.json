Here, we used Nippostrongylus brasiliensis infection as a model of acute lung damage comparing responses between WT and IL-13-deficient mice, in which IL-4 signalling is intact. We found that IL-13 played a critical role in limiting tissue injury and haemorrhaging in the lung, and through proteomic and transcriptomic profiling, identified IL-13-dependent changes in matrix and associated regulators. We further showed a requirement for IL-13 in the induction of epithelial-derived type 2 effector molecules such as RELM-\u03b1 and surfactant protein D.

During anti-parasitic immunity, IL-13 is critical for goblet cell hyperplasia and mucus production at mucosal sites. These responses are particularly essential for the expulsion of gastrointestinal worms from the host. However, the same mucus hypersecretion response is a hallmark of pathogenicity in asthmatic patients. Similarly, IL-13 can induce cytoprotective cytokines such as vascular endothelial growth factor to protect from acute lung injury, yet drive airway smooth muscle cell contraction leading to broncho-constrictive effects during asthma pathogenesis. However, IL-13 and IL-4 have overlapping signalling pathways and both use IL-4R\u03b1. IL-4 signals through the type I receptor (IL-4R\u03b1 paired with the common \u03b3 chain) and the type II receptor (IL-4R\u03b1 paired with IL-13R\u03b11) whereas IL-13 only signals through the type II receptor. However, IL-13 can also ligate IL-13R\u03b12, which serves primarily as a non-signalling decoy receptor but may have signalling functions distinct from IL-13R\u03b11. Consequently, disentangling the relative roles of each cytokine in specific cell types has been challenging. Whereas IL-13 has been a therapeutic target for asthma with ongoing clinical trials, dupilumab, anti-IL-4R\u03b1 which inhibits both IL-4 and IL-13 signalling, has been a front-runner treatment showing efficacy in severe asthma patients.

Furthermore, the role of IL-13 in promoting liver fibrosis, such as during schistosomiasis and other pathologies, is well-characterised. However, there is an apparent context-dependent role for IL-13 in promoting pulmonary fibrosis.

After infection with N. brasiliensis, WT mice had increased Il13 mRNA expression in the lung on D2pi that further increased by D6pi (Fig 1A). By D6pi, T-cell activation (anti-CD3/CD28) in total lung suspensions significantly increased IL-13 protein production (Fig S1). To evaluate the role of IL-13, we used Il13tm3.1Anjm (IL-13 eGFP knock-in) mice, which are deficient for IL-13 when bred as homozygotes (henceforth referred to as Il13\u2212/\u2212). After infection of Il13\u2212/\u2212, we assessed acute bleeding as well the cumulative clearance of blood (Fig 1B). We first measured the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid absorbance at 540 nm, which correlates with the increased presence of haemoglobin because of bleeding. In the absence of IL-13, infected mice had an increased level of airway haemorrhage on D2pi relative to WT mice (Fig 1B). Efferocytosis of red blood cells has been shown to occur in the N. brasiliensis model. Therefore, as an additional measure of bleeding, we assessed the accumulated uptake of red blood cells over time by measurement of haemosiderin within airway macrophages. Consistent with exaggerated bleeding, infected Il13\u2212/\u2212 mice had increased numbers of haemosiderin-laden macrophages in the lung compared with controls, as determined by Prussian blue staining on D6pi (Fig 1B). To assess airway damage after infection, we evaluated H&E\u2013stained lung sections with lacunarity analysis to determine gaps in alveolar structures. By D2pi, Il13\u2212/\u2212 mice had increased lacunarity scores relative to WT (Fig 1C). Upon gross inspection of lung sections from D2pi, it was evident that infected Il13\u2212/\u2212 lungs had larger gaps in the alveoli, presumably in areas proximal to where larvae burst through the tissue (Fig 1D). However, by D6pi lacunarity was comparable between Il13\u2212/\u2212 and WT mice (Fig 1C). In primary infection, IL-13 is only involved in parasite expulsion after the parasites have already cleared the lung tissue. Nonetheless, we assessed the possibility that the exacerbated damage on D2pi in Il13\u2212/\u2212 mice was due to an increased number of larvae entering the lungs in the absence of IL-13. Analysis of Nippostrongylus-specific actin mRNA levels revealed comparable lung-stage parasites between infected WT and mice on D2pi (Fig 1E) These data strongly suggest an early host tissue-protective role for IL-13 in partially limiting airway haemorrhaging and tissue damage immediately after N. brasiliensis entry into the lung.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 7905, "infons": {"file": "LSA-2020-01000_Fig1.jpg", "id": "fig1", "section_type": "FIG", "type": "fig_title_caption"}, "text": "Tissue-protective role for IL-13 during acute lung injury.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 7964, "infons": {"file": "LSA-2020-01000_Fig1.jpg", "id": "fig1", "section_type": "FIG", "type": "fig_caption"}, "text": "WT and Il13\u2212/\u2212 mice were infected with Nippostrongylus brasiliensis (Nb).

Thus, we aimed to characterise the role of IL-13 during the early granulocyte response in the lungs. Using N. brasiliensis infection of Il13\u2212/\u2212 mice, we found that the proportion of infiltrating neutrophils in the BAL was not significantly altered in the absence of IL-13 when compared with infected WT mice on D2pi (Fig 2A). In terms of absolute numbers, Il13\u2212/\u2212 mice only exhibited a slight trend for increased neutrophils compared with controls on D2pi and D4pi (Fig 2B). Between D4-6pi, the parasite larvae have exited the lungs, en route to the small intestine and the granulocyte response shifts towards eosinophilia in the airways. As early as D4pi, Il13\u2212/\u2212 mice had a major reduction in the proportion and number of eosinophils in the BAL relative to infected WT mice and this response was sustained at D6pi (Fig 2A and C). This major reduction in eosinophil proportions in infected Il13\u2212/\u2212 mice accounted for the apparent increase in neutrophil percentage at D4pi and D6pi.

Unlike those settings, in IL-13 cytokine\u2013deficient mice which have intact type I and II IL-4 receptors, IL-4 may compensate for IL-13 deficiency. To evaluate the potential role of IL-4, we first assessed overall susceptibility to N. brasiliensis in the small intestine which is known to be dependent on both IL-4R\u03b1 and IL-13R\u03b11 (i.e., type I and II IL-4 receptors). Where WT mice had largely cleared their parasites, all Il13\u2212/\u2212 mice harboured adult intestinal worms on D6pi (Fig 3A). However, IL-13 can play a role in the differentiation of Th2 cells, and it was therefore possible that increased worm burden in IL-13 deficient mice was due to impaired Th2-cell activation after infection. We therefore assessed lung CD4+ T cells on D6pi by ex vivo stimulation and measurement of intracellular type 2 cytokine expression. We confirmed that lung CD4+ T cells in our Il13\u2212/\u2212 mouse strain expressed eGFP in lieu of functional IL-13 after infection with N. brasiliensis when compared with controls (Fig 3B). Importantly, in the absence of IL-13 expression, neither IL-4 nor IL-5 cytokine expression was changed in CD4+ T cells after infection (Fig 3C). Furthermore, measurement of type 2 cytokine mRNA from whole lung also showed no change in the expression of Il4 and Il5 between infected Il13\u2212/\u2212 and WT mice (Fig 3D).

Although gross changes in lung structure were not evident at day 6 between WT and Il13\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig 1C), it is feasible that changes to physical lung injury in the absence of IL-13, as was seen on D2 post-infection (Fig 1B and C), could have profound effects on the way in which the lung repairs compared with WT animals. To directly address this possibility at the whole tissue level, we performed mass spectrometry on H&E\u2013stained lung sections at D6pi. In infected WT mice, 648 proteins were significantly changed (adjusted P-value < 0.05) relative to uninfected mice with most of these proteins being up-regulated (Fig 4A). We then specifically analysed changes in the ECM and matrix-related proteins (defined from the Matrisome Project), performing hierarchical clustering across groups after N. brasiliensis infection (Fig 4B). Several collagen types (notably collagens I, III, and VI) clustered together, with proteins reduced in WT mice after infection, an effect not replicated in Il13\u2212/\u2212 mice. Such differences may relate to an already lower level of expression of these collagens under basal conditions in Il13\u2212/\u2212 versus WT mice. Evaluation of the relative abundance of collagen types across groups confirmed dysregulated collagen levels in the absence of IL-13, with N. brasiliensis infection altering collagen expression in WT but not Il13\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig 4C). Fibrillar collagens I and III, although already low in Il13\u2212/\u2212 mice, were decreased in infected WT mice and basement membrane-associated collagens IV and VI were also dysregulated in Il13\u2212/\u2212 mice.

Furthermore, hydroxyproline levels were measured as a proxy for total collagen in the lung and confirmed no gross differences between the groups (Fig S2B). To gain further insight into global IL-13\u2013dependent changes in the lung, we performed pathway analysis on differentially expressed proteins (by non-adjusted P-value < 0.05) comparing infected WT and Il13\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig 4D). IL-13-dependent canonical pathway analysis showed a down-regulation (blue) in pathways relating to protein synthesis and cellular stress after infection, with 71% of endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway-associated proteins being regulated by IL-13. In addition, mTOR signalling and antigen presentation pathways appeared to be altered in the absence of IL-13. Although proteomic analysis of lungs from infected Il13\u2212/\u2212 mice did not reveal any differences in matrisome components compared with infected WT mice, RELM-\u03b1 and surfactant protein D (SP-D), two proteins heavily implicated in type 2 immunity, were significantly decreased in infected Il13\u2212/\u2212 lungs amongst the total proteome (Fig S3).

Consistent with previous findings, epithelial cells were the major source of RELM-\u03b1 at these time points, whereas other cellular sources such as alveolar macrophages, neutrophils, and eosinophils, were relatively unchanged in the absence of IL-13 after infection (data not shown). As a complementary experiment, equimolar amounts of systemic IL-4 and IL-13 were each delivered by intraperitoneal injection into WT mice and 18 h later epithelial RELM-\u03b1 expression was measured in the lungs. Both IL-4 and IL-13 injection elicited a comparable expression of RELM-\u03b1 in tissue resident (F4/80hi) macrophages in the peritoneal cavity (Fig S4A). In contrast to IL-4 which had no apparent effect, systemic IL-13 delivery was able to potently drive RELM-\u03b1 expression in CD45\u2013EpCAM+ epithelial cells (Fig 5E). However, we hypothesized that the differences in response to comparable doses of IL-4 versus IL-13 may be due to bioavailability in the lung when delivered systemically. Therefore, we directly administered the cytokines to the lung via intranasal instillation and found that both IL-4 and IL-13 induced epithelial cell derived\u2013RELM-\u03b1 (Fig 5F). Analysis of non-epithelial cells revealed a similar pattern of RELM-\u03b1 expression in airway macrophages in response to IL-4 versus IL-13 when comparing intraperitoneal and intranasal delivery (Fig S4B and C). Taken together, these results show that IL-13 is both necessary and sufficient to stimulate lung epithelial cell RELM-\u03b1. Comparison of intranasal delivery with peritoneal delivery of IL-4 versus IL-13 suggest either that lung epithelial cells and airway macrophages are more sensitive to IL-13 relative to IL-4, or that IL-13 traffics more readily to the lung than IL-4, perhaps because IL-4 is consumed along the way by the more abundant type 1 IL-4 receptors.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23356, "infons": {"file": "LSA-2020-01000_Fig5.jpg", "id": "fig5", "section_type": "FIG", "type": "fig_title_caption"}, "text": "Lung epithelial cell expression and airway release of RELM-\u03b1 is IL-13 dependent.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23441, "infons": {"file": "LSA-2020-01000_Fig5.jpg", "id": "fig5", "section_type": "FIG", "type": "fig_caption"}, "text": "WT and Il13\u2212/\u2212 mice were infected with Nippostrongylus brasiliensis (Nb).

Using the Nanostring Myeloid Innate Immunity v2 panel, we screened for differentially regulated genes across groups on D6pi. Principal component analysis showed distinct separation between groups based on infection status (PC1) and genotype (PC2) (Fig 6A). Genes were grouped by unsupervised hierarchical clustering and differentially expressed genes were represented as a heat map to identify expression patterns across all groups (Fig 6B). Notably, various signature type 2 genes were down regulated in infected Il13\u2212/\u2212 mice such as Chil3/4, Arg1, Il33, Retnla, and the eotaxins (encoded by Ccl11 and Ccl24). Conversely, a cluster of pro-inflammatory genes that included Mmp8, Il18, and Tlr2 were up-regulated in infected IL-13\u2013deficient mice (Fig 6B). Differentially expressed genes were further characterised using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis to identify potential upstream regulators (Fig 6C). Very few regulators were predicted to be up-regulated during IL-13 deficiency but included the airway epithelial cell-associated transcription factor Foxa2 and the adenosine A1 receptor, Adora1. To validate changes in the Foxa2 pathway in the absence of IL-13 during N. brasiliensis infection, we analysed expression of genes known to be regulated by Foxa2 during type 2 settings in the lung. Clca1, Muc5ac, and Ccl11 were confirmed to be highly up-regulated during infection in WT mice but impaired in Il13\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig 6D). Notably, baseline expression of Clca1 and Foxa3 were lower in the lungs of na\u00efve Il13\u2212/\u2212 mice when compared with controls. Foxa2 also negatively regulates Il33 expression, and whereas there was a trend toward Il33 down-regulation on D6pi in the absence of IL-13, this did not reach significance. To better characterise IL-33 expression, we performed immunofluorescence staining of nuclear protein in the lungs following N. brasiliensis infection (Fig 6E). In WT mice expression of nuclear IL-33 was increased in the lung parenchyma, likely alveolar type II epithelial cells, on D2pi when compared with uninfected mice. In contrast, there was no significant increase in nuclear IL-33 in these cells in the absence of IL-13.

For example, IL-4 cytokine\u2013deficient mice, but not IL-4R\u03b1-deficient mice, are able to expel N. brasiliensis from the gut because of intact IL-13 signalling. In addition, IL-13-deficient mice fail to clear N. brasiliensis parasites from the gut when compared with IL-4\u2013deficient and WT mice. Although these studies establish a clear role for IL-13 in mediating type 2 immunity in the small intestine and the establishment of the adaptive immune response, very little is known about the functions of IL-13 in the earlier lung stage of this infection model. Our study reinforces these earlier findings but also reveal a crucial protective role for IL-13 in limiting acute lung injury, promoting airway eosinophilia, and inducing type 2 effector proteins. These lung-specific effects of IL-13 are also consistent with other work showing that pulmonary eosinophilia is impaired in IL-13R\u03b11\u2013deficient mice during asthma. Our results are also highly consistent with a study by that revealed marked epithelial-specific defects in the lungs of IL-13R\u03b11\u2013deficient mice under baseline conditions and during bleomycin-induced pulmonary injury. These IL-13-dependent alterations included many proteins identified in our study including Clca1, RELM-\u03b1, Arginase1, MMP8, and chitinase-like proteins. This study also found that IL-13Ra1 deficiency led to increased bleomycin-induced pathology and together with our data highlights the importance of the IL-13/IL-13R\u03b11 axis in reducing lung injury.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 31036, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Our data demonstrate a profound epithelial cell\u2013specific effect of IL-13 during acute lung injury with N. brasiliensis. Expression of the type I and type II IL-4 receptors is restricted based on cell type. Hematopoietic cells predominantly express the type I receptor, whereas non-hematopoietic cells such as epithelial cells primarily express the type II receptor. Whereas the type II receptor can be ligated by both IL-4 and IL-13, IL-13 can outcompete IL-4 by more efficiently promoting receptor assembly. In terms of epithelial cell expression, a model of mechanical injury shows that IL-13R\u03b11 expression increases at the wound edge in cultured alveolar epithelial cells. As we observed exacerbated airway injury in Il13\u2212/\u2212 mice, it is therefore plausible in our model of nematode-induced lung injury that early alveolar epithelial cell function is dependent on the presence of IL-13. Our study also highlights impaired expression of type 2 effector molecules RELM-\u03b1 and SP-D by lung epithelial cells in the absence of IL-13. RELM-\u03b1 is an IL-4R\u03b1\u2013dependent protein involved in lung tissue repair and has been shown to mediate collagen cross-linking via lysl hydroxylase 2. Interestingly, SP-D has known roles in promoting immunity to N. brasiliensis and is required for the up-regulation of RELM-\u03b1 in the lung. Furthermore, our transcriptional profiling predicted a dysregulation of the transcription factor Foxa2 in the absence of IL-13 after infection. Foxa2 is required for alveolarization and negatively regulates goblet cell hyperplasia. In terms of type 2 function, the predicted increased Foxa2 activity in Il13\u2212/\u2212 mice is consistent with previous studies showing that IL-13 decreases Foxa2 expression to enable mucin production by airway epithelial cells. This is also consistent with our finding that IL-33 expression was impaired in the absence of IL-13, likely via Foxa2 as has been previously shown. We therefore hypothesize a mechanism of IL-13\u2013mediated suppression of Foxa2 in alveolar epithelial cells that enables the expression and release of type 2 effector molecules such as RELM-\u03b1. It is also notable that MMP-8 and IL-18 were up-regulated in infected Il13\u2212/\u2212 mice. MMP-8 and IL-18 are pro-inflammatory markers associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). As N. brasiliensis infection eventually results in emphysema that resemble features of COPD, our data thus suggest a complex role for IL-13 in the development of emphysema.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 33529, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Given the attribution of IL-13 to tissue remodelling and fibrosis in a variety of contexts, we anticipated changes to the matrisome in our acute lung injury model using proteomic analysis.

However, we saw that some major collagens (especially collagen I and III) were reduced in abundance after infection of WT mice. This reduction in the expression of these collagens did not occur in Il13\u2212/\u2212 mice, which already had a baseline decrease in these collagens. It is thus possible that IL-13 has a developmental role in collagen organisation that predisposed the Il13\u2212/\u2212 mice to enhanced tissue injury. A limitation of our matrisome analysis is that we looked at only a single time point (D6pi) and did not account for potential changes in the localisation of specific collagen types and cannot exclude a role for glycosylation state or other post-translational modifications.
